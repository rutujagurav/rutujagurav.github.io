I am a Computer Science graduate student researcher at the University of California Riverside. My area of interest is AI for Science and I focus on acquiring a Data Science/Artificial Intelligence/Data Mining/Machine Learning/Deep Learning skillset through my graduate studies. I enjoy working on machine learning projects and keeping abreast with the AI world (Transformers/LLMs, Diffusion Models, Foundation Models are all the rage, aye?).

I am studying data-driven, machine learning-based solutions to improve the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors as a visiting student researcher at the LIGO Lab @ Caltech. So far I am primarily focused on the problem of noise characterization to improve detection quality. I am also interested in AI for precision agriculture and geospatial sciences to tackle climate change driven challenges to the global food security and disaster response.
