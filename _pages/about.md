I am a Computer Science graduate student researcher at the University of California Riverside. My area of interest is AI for Science and I focus on acquiring a Data Science/Artificial Intelligence/Data Mining/Machine Learning/Deep Learning skillset through my graduate studies. I enjoy working on machine learning projects and keeping abreast with the AI world (G̶A̶N̶s̶ Transformers/LLMs, Diffusion Models, Foundation Models are all the rage, aye?).

I am studying machine learning solutions to improve the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors as a visiting student researcher at the LIGO Lab @ Caltech. So far I am primarily focused on the problem of noise characterization to improve detection quality. I am also passionate about AI for precision agriculture and geospatial sciences to tackle climate change driven challenges to the global food security and disaster response.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
