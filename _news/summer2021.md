Spent a wonderfully productive summer at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) working on an application of Graph Neural Networks for hetergenous data fusion in geospatial data analysis. Check out our work [Conflation of Geospatial POI Data and Ground-level Imagery via Link Prediction on Joint Semantic Graph](https://geoai.ornl.gov/acmsigspatial-geoai/2021-workshop-program/) published at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2021.

Also participated in Lawrence Livermore National Lab's (LLNL) Data Science Institute's (DSI) [Data Science Challenge](https://data-science.llnl.gov/latest/news/data-science-challenge-welcomes-uc-riverside) towards the end of the summer and worked on some cool asteroid detection problems!
